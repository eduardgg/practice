# Practice - Programming Problems

This repository contains a collection of programming problems I have solved, focusing on advanced concepts of **algorithms** and **data structures**, with a strong emphasis on **applied mathematics** and **computational efficiency**.

The problems in this repository span multiple sources, including online forums, competition platforms, and personal explorations. The focus is on solving **classical**, **elegant** and **challenging** problems, often with an analytical approach to **algorithmic complexity** and **optimization**.

### Key Features:
- **CodeForces**: Problems from competitive programming contests, covering a wide range of topics and difficulty levels.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Classic problems often encountered in algorithmic problem-solving.
- **LeetCode**: Problems focusing on algorithms and data structures.
- **Jutge (UPC)**: A collection of problems from the University of Barcelona's online judge, used for academic purposes.
- **CSES**: Some problems from the Code Submission Evaluation System, used for algorithmic practice and assessments.

Each problem is accompanied by a solution, with an emphasis on **elegant implementations**.

Feel free to explore the solutions and the applied techniques. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
